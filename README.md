# Multiple-catch-Statements-in-cpp
$There can be more than one catch block for a single try block. 
$Each catch must catch a different type of exception. 
$For example, this program catches both integers and strings.

each catch statement responds only to its own type.
In general, catch expressions are checked in the order in which they occur in a program. 
Only a matching statement is executed. All other catch blocks are ignored.
